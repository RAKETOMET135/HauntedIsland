# Haunted Island

## Game informations

**This game is about surviving on randomly generated island, where every night monsters appear. Player's goal is to not only survive, but to also build a whole ship and sail away from the island.**

**There is a crafting system where players can craft various items. For example they can craft axes, spears, shovels, pickaxes, torches and much more. In total there is 100+ items players can obtain.**
**Cutting trees, bushes or mining rocks is crucial to progress through the game.**

**To make make survival like it should be, I added hunger and thirst. It is important to consider these when attempting this amazing survival on this haunted island.**
**Players can try other activities like fishing, digging dirt or even using a drill.**
**Planting seeds can be one of the ways to get food. These seeds can be watered to lower the growth time.**

**Survival can be difficult, but wild life on the island can help them with their journey. Meat chickens and collect eggs, get milk from cows and much more.**

**To make things suited even for true gamers, I added bossfight to the game. Fight Zirb the only true owner of the haunted island to be able to power your ship. Be ready for Zirb's deadly speed in his majestic flying.**

**Visiting a village can greatly improve the survival chances. Trade with local villagers to obtain special items or just sell wood and other stuff for gold.**

**Players can expirience rain or just use it for watering seeds. The choice is theirs.**

**There are 3 difficulties that they can chose from: Sanbox, Normal and Nightmare. Nightmare is designed to test the true survival instincts of players. All things are made to be more diffcult.**
